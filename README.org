A nix derivation for the ROMS plotting toolbox.

For more information on ROMS, see the [[http://www.myroms.org/][official website]]. Information about the
plotting toolbox can be found on its [[https://www.myroms.org/wiki/Plotting_Package_Installation][ROMS wiki page]].

*Caveats:* All of the ROMS source repos are private, so you will need create a
 =myroms= account before you can download them. Then, once you have successfully
 downloaded the plotting package, this derivation's ~src~ attribute will have to
 be set against your local checkout of the sources. Note that naively setting
 ~src~ to a path like this renders the derivation non-reproducible (since the
 source isn't checked against a hash). In the future I'd like to change this to
 set ~src~ to some more intelligent fetcher that actually hashes the source.
